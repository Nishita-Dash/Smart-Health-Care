     *   Getting an error for this call is something that the user should be made aware of. You don't have to tell all the

     *   Otherwise they might start speculating in why there are no results on screen, and in worst case scenario they might
     *   think that the query yielded 0 matches, which is potentially and probably not the truth.
     *
     * - Categorize (severity = 2):
     *   Errors while querying for categories are considered important, but less important than the Find errors. The reason
     *   is that the categories themselves are normally not the end-results that the user is waiting for. They are "meta" to the
     *   actual matches, and they are also a tool to help the user narrow down on the results, helping them find the data they
